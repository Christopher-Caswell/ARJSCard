# ARJSCard

## A whole lot of business will be going into this card, long term.

## For now, I want a simple card that supplies some links to my professsional data and shows a little bit of who I am.

## the image to scan for response is at [this place, right here](https://github.com/Christopher-Caswell/ARJSCard/blob/main/assets/me.png) and will probably be updated a much slower rate than my face itself.

## the QR code that leads here is located at [hither](https://github.com/Christopher-Caswell/ARJSCard/blob/main/assets/QRCode.png), of course. Hate to not have circular references somewhere.
