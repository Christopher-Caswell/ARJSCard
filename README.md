#### This is a continuous location wherein I can show people my pretty face and propensity for trying and developing new projects. This AR card will lead you to my Github, LinkedIn, and other social media accounts. This page most likely showed up on your radar because you already have my card.

#### For now, the primary goal of this repository is a simple card that supplies some links to professsional data.<br>

#### The image to scan for response is [hither](https://github.com/Christopher-Caswell/ARJSCard/blob/main/assets/me.png) and will probably be updated a much slower rate than my face itself. The QR code that leads here is located at [yon](https://github.com/Christopher-Caswell/ARJSCard/blob/main/assets/QRCode.png), of course. Hate to not have circular references somewhere. You can use the above images as well.

#### The project itself was created with the use of A-Frame, a Javascript library produced in ARJS by [these beautiful people](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js)

#### Any future updates and revisions will mostly be the projects of which I am proud or my actual portfolio.

> The process for using this card is as simple as:
>> Scan the QR code with a modern phone browser<br>
>> Allow the phone permission to access this repo<br>
>> Scan the picture of me in black border<br>
>> An AR environment should populate<br>
>> Proliferate my glory throughout the world
